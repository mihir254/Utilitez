This application is built using NextJS and MongoDB. It's main purpose is to automate processes that I regularly spend time on. I keep adding new features to it as and when I recognize / find habits or things that are repititive and can be automated.<br /><br />
Intention behind using NextJS was to learn and understand the framework that provides API support and great optimization options like CSR and SSR. Past experience with ReactJS and styling libraries like ChakraUI, helped me build this application very quickly.

This application is made for my personal use, and I am scaling it so that it can be used by more people. (Those who know about this project, have requested me to scale it so that they can use it too and save some time! ðŸ˜‰)
